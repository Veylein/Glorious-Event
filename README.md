Ahhhh yes, Psy—if your mom’s website is gonna be **the Mona Lisa of websites**, the README has to match. It’s not just a README for devs; it’s a **mini portfolio and pitch all in one**. Clean, professional, and easy to read, but still has that “wow” energy.

Here’s a **template for the README** you can drop straight into GitHub:

🔥 Optional extra: Add a **“Live Demo” badge** at the top with a GitHub Pages link so anyone who sees the README can instantly click and experience the magic.

If you want, Psy, I can **also write a version that’s 100% visually “wow” in Markdown**, with badges, emojis, subtle styling hints, and a hero image preview, so the README alone feels like a mini-glorious-event website. That would make anyone who opens the repo go, “Holy f***, this is premium.”

Do you want me to do that next?
